## Simple Math Functions

R can perform very simple mathematical calculations in console and command line windows. There are some built in constants such as pi.

```{r echo = FALSE}

8 + 5
10 - 6/2
(10 - 6)/2
10*5
15/5
10^5
3 * pi

```

## Assignments of Variables

Variables can take the form of any combination of letters and numbers, and can start with a period (cannot be followed by a number if the variable name starts with a period). You can use these variables in place of the exact numerical value (if applicable) in the simple mathematical functions done above, and more. A variable can also hold the solution to a simple mathematical function if you're too lazy to do it or if they're stored in variables.

```{r echo = FALSE}

x <- 6
x
y <- 5
y

z <- x * y
z
x2 <- x^2
x2

```
